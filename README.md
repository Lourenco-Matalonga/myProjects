# myProjects

This repository is where i share all my side projects that i do to practice JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3!

Hope you guys enjoy it! To become a good Programming developer like everything in life requires loads of practice.

At same time i try to remember myself that being a programming developer means being a creator.

So being creative is also a big thing for me and will try to show my creativity in all my projects.
